    "GPT models are types of deep learning models. Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning, which in turn is a subfield of AI.<br>\n",

    "**The key part of GPT is the prediction step**, where the network predicts what words will come next. To do this, the network uses its parameters.<br>\n",
    "You can think of parameters like memory. This memory has been trained on a lot of data (gigabytes or terabytes).<br>\n",
    "Parameters enable neural networks to make accurate predictions about what should come after your prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "The smallest GPT models have around 100M parameters, and the largest known ones have 176B.<br>\n",
    "They use parameters to transform your input to predictions - usually by adding the parameters to your input, or multiplying your input by the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this course, you will understand how to train deep neural networks that work like GPT.<br>\n",
    "This course is split into three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understanding deep learning - how to create and train deep neural networks, including gradient descent and backpropagation.\n",
    "2. Deep learning for NLP - deep learning architectures to work with text, including RNNs, encoder/decoders, attention, and transformers.\n",
    "3. Scaling up models - putting together the building blocks to train a model with a large number of parameters.\n",

    "In each lesson, you'll learn the theory behind what you're doing, and code *complete implementations that solve problems*.<br>\n",
    "For example, in the dense neural networks lesson, you'll learn the fundamental theory - backpropagation, why nonlinearities are essential, and how multiple layers work.<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "- This is **not a course where you'll just import PyTorch** and type code without understanding what you're doing. We'll build up your knowledge step by step.\n",
    "- This is **not a mathematically rigorous course**. We'll include the math, but we'll focus on building intuition and understanding first.\n",
